# Batch file renamer

This can be used to rename batches of files with similiar names. Made to be as simple as possible but still have the functionality that I want. I mostly use it to rename audio files when I want to change the format of the filenames. The GUI was designed using Qt Creator and the PySide framework for Qt bindings.
